Hugo is a static site generator — a tool that helps you build fast, secure, and easy-to-maintain websites.

Instead of using databases and dynamic servers, Hugo generates **static HTML files** from Markdown and templates.

## Why Use Hugo?

- ⚡ Fast — builds thousands of pages in seconds.
- 🛠️ Simple — only needs folders and Markdown files.
- 📦 Flexible — great for blogs, docs, portfolios, and more.

## Example Structure

```plaintext
content/
  └── blog/
      └── what-is-hugo.md
themes/
  └── my-theme/
config.toml
```

## Why Choose It?

For projects like documentation or personal blogs, Hugo is lightweight and practical. You don’t need expensive hosting — just deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify.
