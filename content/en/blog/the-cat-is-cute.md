A few days ago, I saw an orange cat sleeping on the porch. It curled up like a cinnamon roll and meowed quietly in its sleep.

## Why Are Cats Cute?

Soft fur, innocent faces, and strange sleeping positions make cats hard to dislike. Even when they scratch the couch, we forgive them.

### Fun Facts

- Cats can sleep up to 16 hours a day
- They lick their fur to clean themselves
- They love warm spots (like your laptop!)

## Final Words

There's no deeper message here. Just a simple note: cats are cute. That’s all.
