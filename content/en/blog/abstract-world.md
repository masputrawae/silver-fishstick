Imagine a world not governed by the laws of physics, where colors do not require light, and space bends at will. This world is not real, yet not entirely fictional. The abstract world lives in the boundaries of thought.

## Thought as the Map

In the abstract world, maps do not reflect territories. Instead, territories follow the shapes of maps. Imagination becomes the unit of measurement, not reality. Here, concepts are more important than objects.

## Liquid Time

There is no morning or night. Only mood changes. Time doesn't move forward — it circles and sometimes flows backward.

## What's the Point?

Maybe this text doesn't matter. But it's here for one reason: to test how the blog system renders paragraphs, headings, quotes, lists, and more.

### Test List

- Long paragraphs
- H2 and H3 headings
- Blockquotes
- Unordered lists
- Frontmatter with `description`, `tags`, and `date`
